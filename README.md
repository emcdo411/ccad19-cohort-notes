# üß† MSSA Cloud App Dev Notes ‚Äì C#, Docker & .NET Core

*A practical introduction to compiled languages in a modern cloud workflow*

---

### üí° Why C# Needs a Compiler:

C# is a **compiled language**, which means the code you write (called **source code**) must be **translated into a lower-level language** before the computer can run it. This is done by the **C# compiler**, which turns your `.cs` files into **Intermediate Language (IL)**. The **.NET runtime (CLR)** then translates IL into **machine code** just-in-time (JIT), when your app runs.

> ‚úÖ This makes C# fast, secure, and great for building enterprise-scale cloud applications.

---

### üê≥ Why Use Docker with .NET?

Docker lets you run your C#/.NET app in a **lightweight container** that works the same everywhere ‚Äî on your dev machine, in Azure, or in production.

Benefits:

* üöÄ **Portability**: "Build once, run anywhere"
* üîê **Isolation**: Keeps dependencies clean
* üß™ **Testability**: Run multiple versions without conflict
* üìÜ **CI/CD Ready**: Plug into GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, etc.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Sample Dockerfile for .NET Core App

```dockerfile
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:6.0 AS base
WORKDIR /app
EXPOSE 80

FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:6.0 AS build
WORKDIR /src
COPY ["MyApp/MyApp.csproj", "MyApp/"]
RUN dotnet restore "MyApp/MyApp.csproj"
COPY . .
WORKDIR "/src/MyApp"
RUN dotnet build "MyApp.csproj" -c Release -o /app/build

FROM build AS publish
RUN dotnet publish "MyApp.csproj" -c Release -o /app/publish

FROM base AS final
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=publish /app/publish .
ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "MyApp.dll"]
```

### üß© Can You Run Git Reset from GitHub Web UI?

While GitHub‚Äôs front end is user-friendly, it doesn‚Äôt support all command-line features like `git reset --soft` directly. However, here‚Äôs what you *can* and *can‚Äôt* do:

#### ‚úÖ GitHub Web Features That Overlap with Git CLI

| Feature                       | What It Does                              | CLI Equivalent         |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| ‚úÖ Revert a commit             | Undoes a commit with a new one            | `git revert`           |
| üóëÔ∏è Delete a file via UI      | Opens a PR to remove a file               | `git rm`, `git commit` |
| üîÑ Rebase/squash via PR       | Allows rewriting history before merge     | `git rebase -i`        |
| ‚úçÔ∏è Edit commit messages in PR | Adjust messages when squashing or merging | `git commit --amend`   |

#### ‚ùå Limitations in the GitHub Web UI

* `git reset --soft`, `--mixed`, or `--hard` not supported
* No ability to rewire `HEAD` or move branch pointers
* Cannot selectively stage changes from UI like with `git add -p`

#### ‚úÖ Alternatives for Non-Terminal Users

| Tool              | Benefit                                                 |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| GitHub Desktop    | Visual history, undo, discard changes                   |
| GitKraken         | GUI-based Git with partial reset & rebase functionality |
| VS Code + GitLens | Interactive staging, commit viewer, timeline controls   |

> üí° Pro Tip: If you need the behavior of `git reset --soft` in a visual way, GitHub Desktop or GitLens inside VS Code are your best bet.------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
> \| ‚úÖ Initialize Git            | `git init`                                   | Starts tracking your project with Git locally       |
> \| üìÖ Clone a repo from GitHub | `git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git` | Downloads a copy of a remote GitHub project         |
> \| ‚ûï Stage changes             | `git add .` or `git add MyFile.cs`           | Prepares changes to be committed                    |
> \| üìÇ Commit changes           | `git commit -m "Add login feature"`          | Saves a version snapshot with a message             |
> \| üöÄ Push to GitHub           | `git push origin main`                       | Uploads your local commits to GitHub                |
> \| üîÑ Pull from GitHub         | `git pull origin main`                       | Gets the latest changes from the remote GitHub repo |
> \| üîç Check status             | `git status`                                 | Shows which files have been changed or staged       |
> \| üìú View commit history      | `git log --oneline`                          | Displays a clean list of past commits               |
> \| ‚ú® Create a new branch       | `git checkout -b feature/new-ui`             | Starts a new branch for isolated development        |
> \| ‚Ü∫ Merge a branch            | `git merge feature/new-ui`                   | Combines a branch into the current one              |

> üëá Pro Tip: Always commit small and often. It's easier to track and rollback changes if needed.

### üîÑ GitHub Enterprise Multi-Repo Migration Steps

If you're migrating several GitHub repositories to GitHub Enterprise, here‚Äôs a clear overview of the process:

#### ‚úÖ Step-by-Step Migration Workflow

| Step | Action                                                                                                        |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1Ô∏è‚É£  | **Pre-Migration Audit**: List all repos, teams, permissions, secrets, CI/CD integrations.                     |
| 2Ô∏è‚É£  | **Set up the destination org** in GitHub Enterprise (Cloud or Server).                                        |
| 3Ô∏è‚É£  | **Create personal access tokens** with admin rights on source and target.                                     |
| 4Ô∏è‚É£  | Clone all repos with full history using mirror: <br> `git clone --mirror https://github.com/old-org/repo.git` |
| 5Ô∏è‚É£  | Push each mirror to the new org: <br> `git push --mirror https://github.com/new-org/repo.git`                 |
| 6Ô∏è‚É£  | Rebuild repo settings (branches, webhooks, deploy keys, Actions secrets).                                     |
| 7Ô∏è‚É£  | Recreate team structures using the **GitHub REST API or CLI scripting**.                                      |
| 8Ô∏è‚É£  | Test everything ‚Äî Actions pipelines, integrations, SSO logins.                                                |
| 9Ô∏è‚É£  | **Lock old repos** (read-only) and notify users.                                                              |
| üîü   | Monitor logs and access patterns post-migration.                                                              |

#### üõ†Ô∏è Recommended Tools

* GitHub CLI (`gh`) for repo creation and permissions
* REST or GraphQL API for automation
* Bash or PowerShell scripting for bulk operations
* GitHub Enterprise Importer or `ghe-migrator` (for GHES)
